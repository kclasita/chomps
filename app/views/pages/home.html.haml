        %p <a href="/Chomp--Black.pdf">Download it here.</a> Print the top and bottom onto cardstock. The thicker paper helps with the durability of the toy.
        %p Cut around the outside of the pattern with scissors or Exacto.
        %p Gently score along the dashed lines with pen cap. This helps to create crisper folds.

        %p Take the finished head and slide it into the unglued side of the bottom. Be sure the colors of the teeth match up.
        %p Repeat Step 3 on tabs G and H. This is the trickiest part, as there is little room between the top and the sides.
